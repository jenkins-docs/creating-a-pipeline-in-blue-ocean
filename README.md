# creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean


This repository is for the
[Create a Pipeline in Blue Ocean](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/create-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean/)
tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

This tutorial uses the same application that the [Build a Node.js and React app
with
npm](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/)
tutorial is based on. Therefore, you'll be building the same application
although this time, completely through Blue Ocean.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
that Blue Ocean will create for you during the tutorial and the `scripts`
subdirectory contains shell scripts with commands that are executed when Jenkins
processes the "Test" and "Deliver" stages of your Pipeline.
